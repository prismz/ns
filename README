ns stands for nimble status. It is written for dwm, and supports using X root
window name (think of xsetroot -name) and to stdout using the -s command line argument. 

Supports:
    - cmus info
    - packages installed using portage
    - current keymap
    - free disk space of root disk
    - uptime
    - load average for last minute
    - memory usage
    - time last status took to generate (for debugging)
    - date/time (strftime)

Compile using make, install using make install, and remove using make clean. By default will install to /usr/local/bin/.

Sample output:

04:36 / 06:09 SongName.mp3 | 868 pkgs | 524G free | up 1 day, 18:31 | 2.25 | 5723MiB | 0.000326s | Saturday July 17 05:21:19 PM

To edit which elements show up in the status, edit status_components in config.h. Each component will appear in the order specified.
You can also customize the separator (by default is " | ")

The time is formatted using strftime. You can specify a custom format in config.h.
